It should be designed to be in compliance with national legislation implementing Directive (EU) 2016/2102 of the European Parliament. The following accessibility statement applies to the Citykey apps for Android and iOS.</p><p><h4><strong>Status of compatibility with respect to the requirements for barrier-free information technology</strong></h4></p><p>This app is currently not yet fully compatible with the requirements according to BITV. The accessibility of the app is undergoing constant improvements as part of our development process.&nbsp;</p><p><h4><strong>Non-accessible content</strong></h4></p><p><em>Contrast</em></p><p>There is currently some content for which the contrast is too low. We are currently looking into how we can increase the contrast in line with Citykey's color scheme.</p><p><em>Button size</em></p><p>Some clickable objects (e.g. buttons, links) in the Android app may be a bit too small for users with motor weaknesses. We are currently investigating to what extent changes to the size are possible and useful.</p><p><em>Dynamic text size in iOS</em></p><p>Citykey for iOS does not support dynamic text sizes at the moment. We are currently planning to successively support this feature throughout the apps.</p><p><h4><strong>Creation of this accessibility statement</strong></h4></p><p>This statement was created on July 30, 2021.&nbsp;The assessment is based on self-assessment, with the support of accessibility testing software tools, and with the assistance of a visually impaired user.</p><p><h4><strong>Feedback and contact</strong></h4></p><p>We appreciate feedback on the accessibility of our app. Have you discovered any other barriers in our app or do you have any questions about accessibility?
